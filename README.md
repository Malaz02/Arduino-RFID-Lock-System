# Arduino-RFID-Lock-System

The RFID Lock System using Arduino is an innovative security solution that combines Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology with microcontroller capabilities. Utilizing an Arduino board and the RC522 RFID module, this project allows for secure access control by reading authorized RFID tags to unlock a door. When a valid tag is detected, the system deactivates the electromagnetic solenoid to disengage the lock, providing real-time feedback through an LCD display. This project highlights the effectiveness of RFID technology in enhancing security while showcasing the versatility of Arduino in practical applications.
